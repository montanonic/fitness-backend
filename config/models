-- TODO:

-- Add entities for logging message/comment data, so that we can have edit
-- histories.

-- Add logging entities for likes.

-- Figure out if it's better for like entities to be separated to be specific
-- to comments or posts, or to be consolidated into a single Like entity with
-- NULLable fields referring either to a CommentId or PostId, as it is now.

------------------------------------USER INFO-----------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--#User

User json
    ident Text -- For Auth through Yesod

    firstName Text
    lastName Text

    password Text

    dateOfBirth Day

    createdAt UTCTime
    updatedAt UTCTime Maybe -- Allowed fields: ident.

    UniqueUser ident

    deriving Typeable Read Eq Show
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--#Profile ; data: Gender

-- | This is what the old User entity used to be, but it now references the new
-- User table, which stores the unique identifying information for that person.

Profile json
    user UserId

    firstName Text
    lastName Text

    gender Gender -- See Model/Persistent -> Gender

    -- lastLogin UTCTime -- not sure if I should implement

    createdAt UTCTime
    updatedAt UTCTime Maybe -- Allowed fields: ALL BUT user.

    UniqueProfile user -- This makes it easy to fetch all profile info with a
      -- UserId. We can easily get that Id with maybeAuthId

    deriving Read Eq Show

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--#ProfileLog ; data: UserUpdate

-- | Prevents data loss from meaningful changes to the Profile entity. Currently
-- omits logging of LogIns and LogOuts, as that seems a bit overboard;
-- however it may be worth discussing the potential value of such a feature.
--
-- Every log action here is an UPDATE.

ProfileLog
    user UserId

    action ProfileUpdate -- UpdateFirstName, UpdateLastName, UpdateEmail,
      -- UpdateDateOfBirth, UpdateGender.
    previousValue Text -- all values are converted to text so that we don't
      -- have to use multiple fields to satisfy differing data types.

    createdAt UTCTime -- These logs are recorded at the same time a change
      -- is made. Hence, this is the timestamp of the change.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--#ProfileOptions

-- | One example of options would be a user's display preferences for their
-- profile in terms of what personal information they want to show on their
-- wall.

-- Leaving this un-implemented for now, while I wait to figure out how to best
-- structure this model.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--#Friendship

Friendship json
    firstUser UserId -- This *must always* be the user who *sent* the friend
      -- request
    secondUser UserId

    becameFriends UTCTime Maybe -- if NULL, the first user sent a request, and
      -- the second never accepted.

    whoDefriended UserId Maybe -- if this field is NOT NULL, the Friendship is
      -- deactivated, but we do not delete it.

    createdAt UTCTime
    updatedAt UTCTime Maybe -- Allowed fields: becameFriends, whoDefriended.

    UniqueFriendship firstUser secondUser -- in queries we might need to also
      -- search for UniqueFriendship secondUser firstUser as well, to ensure
      -- that we find the relationship. Just a reminder in case behavior is
      -- ever buggy in this table.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--#FriendshipLog ; data: FriendshipAction

-- | The idea with this is to make sure that we have a full history of any
-- Friendship-level actions.
-- Logging will only occur when a field in Friendship is overwritten.

FriendshipLog
    friendship FriendshipId
    user UserId -- who performed the action

    action FriendshipAction -- SendRequest, AcceptRequest, or Defriend.
    timestamp UTCTime

    createdAt UTCTime -- When the log was recorded is distinct from when
      -- the action was made (the 'timestamp'). These values should never be
      -- identical, as logs are not made at the same time actions are taken.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------CONVERSATIONS---------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--#ConversationUser

-- | Points a User to a Conversation. When created the isActive field will be
-- true, indicating that they will receive updates to the conversation and it
-- will remain visible to them.

ConversationUser json
    conversation ConversationId
    user UserId

    isActive Bool -- This field determines if the user will have the
      -- conversation displayed in their messages tab within the App.
      -- See documentation for more information on how this field is used.

    createdAt UTCTime
    updatedAt UTCTime Maybe -- Allowed fields: isActive.
      -- If this field is not null, and isActive is false, the user de-activated
      -- the conversation at this time; if isActive is true, then the user at
      -- one point de-activated the conversation, and re-activated it at this
      -- time.

    UniqueConversationUser conversation user -- only 1 user per conversation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--#ConversationMessage

-- | A single conversation contains 1 or more messages. This table contains
-- each message, along with the Conversation it points to.

ConversationMessage json
    conversation ConversationId
    content Text
    author UserId

    createdAt UTCTime
    updatedAt UTCTime Maybe -- Allowed fields: message(?).
        -- non-null entries in this field will indicate the time the last edit
        -- was made to a message (supposing we allow edits)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--#Conversation

-- | The entries for this table are sparse. That's because it will be used in
-- SQL Joins to link between the ConversationUsers and ConversationMessages.
-- See the documentation for more information.

Conversation json
    createdAt UTCTime -- conversations will be created when a user first sends a
      -- ConversationMessage to one or more users.
    updatedAt UTCTime Maybe
      -- this field will be updated every time a new message is posted to the
      -- conversation.
      -- Depending on how well this works, we may want to get rid of this field
      -- entirely and get this information solely from the most recent
      -- ConversationMessage entity.

--#Like

Like json
    liker UserId

    -- The following does not seem to be the most elegant solution to the
    -- problem of connecting a Like to either a Post or a PostComment.

    -- RULE: A Like can refer to EITHER a Post or a PostComment. Hence, one of
    -- these fields must remain NULL.
    post WallPostId Maybe
    comment PostCommentId Maybe

    createdAt UTCTime

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--#PostComment

-- | I know this sounds like an action but it is not; it should be read as a
-- noun, not a verb. This table references Post Comments to an actual WallPost
-- (identified by the WallPost table). This is a many-to-one relationship.

-- Currently lacks support for Media types.

PostComment json
    post WallPostId
    content Text
    author UserId

    likeCount Int

    -- Unimplemented but we may want to allow for nested comments.
    --nestedUnder PostCommentId Maybe -- Used only if this comment is nested
      -- under another comment, rather than being a top-level comment to the
      -- Post itself.

    createdAt UTCTime
    updatedAt UTCTime Maybe -- Allowed fields: content(?).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--#WallPost

-- Not named "Post" in order to avoid name-conflicts with the HTTP POST method.
-- Currently lacks support for Media types.

WallPost json
